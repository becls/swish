# Swish Concurrency Engine

The Swish Concurrency Engine is a framework used to write
fault-tolerant programs with message-passing concurrency. It uses the
Chez Scheme programming language and embeds concepts from the Erlang
programming language. Swish also provides a web server.

# Design

Swish uses [libuv](http://libuv.org) for cross-platform asynchronous
I/O.

# Notes

- `cd src; ./go` builds and runs the engine.
- Disable the expression editor with --eedisable because Chez Scheme's
  expression editor does not use asynchronous console I/O. We would
  have to modify the places where s/expeditor.ss calls `$ee-read-char`
  in blocking mode to use libuv's asynchronous read function instead
  of the one in c/expeditor.c.

# Build System Requirements

## Linux

- Chez Scheme 9.5.1 from June 14, 2018 or later
- GCC, the GNU Compiler Collection
- GNU C++ compilter for libuv
- Python 2.7 for libuv
- uuid-dev package

## Mac

- Chez Scheme 9.5.1 from June 14, 2018 or later
- XCode must be installed and the command line tools must be set (Xcode->Preferences->Locations->command line tools)
- pdflatex (can be installed through homebrew using `brew cask install mactex`)
- dot (can be installed through homebrew using `brew install graphviz --with-app`)

## Windows

- Chez Scheme 9.5.1 from June 14, 2018 or later
- Cygwin with bash, git, graphviz, grep, perl, texlive, etc.
- Microsoft Visual Studio 2017 or 2015 with Visual C++
- Python 2.7 for Windows in C:\Python27
- Put scheme in PATH.

### Building on Windows with Anaconda Python

- One time, make an [environment containing Python 2.7](https://conda.io/docs/user-guide/tasks/manage-python.html#installing-a-different-version-of-python)

  `conda create -n py27 python=2.7 anaconda`

- When libuv needs to be rebuilt:

  ```
  source activate py27
  PYTHON="$(cygpath -w "$(type -p python)")" ./go
  ```
