# Swish Concurrency Engine

The Swish Concurrency Engine is a framework used to write
fault-tolerant programs with message-passing concurrency. It uses the
Chez Scheme programming language and embeds concepts from the Erlang
programming language. Swish also provides a web server.

# [Design](https://becls.github.io/swish/swish.pdf)

Swish uses [libuv](http://libuv.org) for cross-platform asynchronous
I/O.

Although Swish can be run in threaded Chez Scheme for convenience, it
is not thread safe and should be used from the main thread only.

# Notes

1. install the prerequisites (see Build System Requirements)
2. `./configure` (see `./configure --help` for options)
3. `make`
4. `make test`

- After `./configure`; you can also `cd src; ./go` to build and run the engine.
- We disable the expression editor with --eedisable because Chez Scheme's
  expression editor does not use asynchronous console I/O. We would
  have to modify the places where s/expeditor.ss calls `$ee-read-char`
  in blocking mode to use libuv's asynchronous read function instead
  of the one in c/expeditor.c.
- If you get a "symbol(s) not found" error, you may need to use CPPFLAGS
  and LDFLAGS to supply the header and library path. If the C compiler
  refuses unused arguments, you may need
  `CFLAGS="-Qunused-arguments"`. e.g.,
  ```
  ./configure CPPFLAGS="-I/usr/local/opt/libiconv/include" CFLAGS="-Qunused-arguments" LDFLAGS="-L/usr/local/opt/libiconv/lib"
  ```

# Build System Requirements

## Linux

- Chez Scheme 9.5.2 or later
- GCC, the GNU Compiler Collection
- GNU C++ compiler for libuv
- GNU make
- Python 2.7 for libuv
- uuid-dev package

## Mac

- Chez Scheme 9.5.2 or later
- dot (can be installed through homebrew using `brew install graphviz --with-app`)
- pdflatex (can be installed through homebrew using `brew cask install mactex`)
- ginstall and realpath (can be installed through homebrew using `brew install coreutils`)
- XCode and the command-line tools must be set (Xcode->Preferences->Locations->command line tools)

## Windows

- Chez Scheme 9.5.2 or later
- Cygwin or MinGW/MSYS with bash, git, graphviz, grep, perl, texlive,
  GNU make, etc.
- Microsoft Visual Studio 2017 or 2015 with Visual C++
- Python 2.7 for Windows in C:\Python27 (see below for other options)
- Put scheme in PATH.

### Building on Windows with Miniconda Python

- Install [Python 2.7](https://conda.io/miniconda.html)
- Provide the path to the python2.7 executable as an argument to the configure script:
  ```
  ./configure --python=~/Miniconda2/python.exe
  ```

### Building on Windows with Anaconda Python

- Make an [environment containing Python 2.7](https://conda.io/docs/user-guide/tasks/manage-python.html#installing-a-different-version-of-python)

  `conda create -n py27 python=2.7 anaconda`

- Provide the path to the python2.7 executable as an argument to the configure script:
  ```
  ./configure --python=~/Anaconda3/envs/py27/python.exe
  ```

# Stand-alone Swish Applications

Swish can be used to build, test, and deploy stand-alone
applications. A given application might load foreign code for image
processing or USB access. Code that may block should use the API
described in Section
[2.3](https://becls.github.io/swish/swish.pdf#section.2.3) to
integrate with Swish's I/O loop.

### Build

For details about building a Swish application, see:
`swish-build --help`

### Test

For details about testing a Swish application, see:
`swish-test --help`

### Deploying a Stand-alone Application

On Linux and macOS, you can deploy your application's executable and
boot file.

On Windows, your install should include the application's executable
and boot file, `osi.dll`, `libuv.dll`, `sqlite3.dll`, Chez Scheme's
`csv952.dll`, and Microsoft's C Runtime Library `vcruntime140.dll`.

Developers writing stand-alone applications should clone the Swish
repository and run `configure`.  Swish's source repository provides
`swish.h` to define callable exports for `osi.dll`. `Mf-config` can be
used in makefiles to define variables for system-specific paths.
